Justification:
Have you ever felt like it was a lot of work to put together a personalized resume for each job you’re applying to?  \n
You have the skills, but you need to be able to show them off without including meaningless bullets?  \n
Keep getting rejected by the automatic resume checkers because your wording is just slightly different than the job posting?  \n
This tool can help maintain your data and quickly populate your resume with just the data you want.  
High level plan:
Allow a user to input all their past data into one convenient location. \n
This data can then be selected or rejected before being populated into word documents.  \n
These documents will be user modifiable so that many resume templates can be utilized.  \n
\n
\n
Extras: \n
Parse a job announcement and extract (or allow the user to extract) key words.  \n
Find synonyms to these key words that match entries the user has already created and suggest the best bullets and the modifications to bullets to match the job description.
Maintain different versions of the user’s bullets that the user can select between. \n
