<h1> RESUME BUILDER </h1>

<h2>Justification:</h2>
<p>Have you ever felt like it was a lot of work to put together a personalized resume for each job you’re applying to?</p>
<p>You have the skills, but you need to be able to show them off without including meaningless bullets?</p>
<p>Keep getting rejected by the automatic resume checkers because your wording is just slightly different than the job posting?</p>
<p>This tool can help maintain your data and quickly populate your resume with just the data you want.</p>  
High level plan:</h2>
<p>Allow a user to input all their past data into one convenient location.</p>
<p>This data can then be selected or rejected before being populated into word documents.</p>
<p>These documents will be user modifiable so that many resume templates can be utilized.</p>

<h2>Extras:</h2>
<p>Parse a job announcement and extract (or allow the user to extract) key words.</p>
<p>Find synonyms to these key words that match entries the user has already created and suggest the best bullets </p>
<p>and the modifications to bullets to match the job description.
<p>Maintain different versions of the user’s bullets that the user can select between.</p>
